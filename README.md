# Additional_Scripts

This repository adds additional patches on-top of the basic Pyra Repo at https://packages.pyra-handheld.com/bookworm

Eventually this will work with all the other repositories but for just targeting bookworm

Scripts must be root level and zipped with a .sh script to execute.

Please also put some form of output (echo "This is a patch for the horse in the code")
